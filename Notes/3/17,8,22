Writing variable to file, so it looks like random letters and numbers, however, variable is set to nothing.
Using debugger to see when file has something inside it, program removes the contents.
Found out that i have set variable for writing to regular file - not encoded variable.

Next:
    Make file view encoded password by changing variable to encoded variable.
