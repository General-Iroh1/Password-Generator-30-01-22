Working on random password generator, (so far done length)
Letters aren't following length - working to fix.
using while loop to check if length of password and how many letters have been generated are equal.
Finished letter generator - now need to stick all the letters together.


Next:
    Figure out why list isn't appending
    add a button to ask for 3 inputs
    add symbols to random generated password.
