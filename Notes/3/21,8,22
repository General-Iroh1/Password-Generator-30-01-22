Fixed create pass route
working on fixing back buttons.
I was trying to make an entirely new view pass function, and realised i could just use session() for back buttons.
Fixed back buttons, however on delete pass screen, it isn't deleting the choice screen, even though i've written screen5.destroy()
Made only one screen using withdraw.
Getting an error when withdrawing, also you have to delete the terminal to launch the code again - guessing this is because of withdraw()
Options screen wasn't deleting because i made a different session function that had the create pass back button inside it.


Next:
    Add only 2 screens when pressing the register button.
