Found out that if im going to encrypt at the end, i need to make it remeber the variable that has the original value in it when the code is run a different time.
Encryption isn't working?
ThE fUnCtIoN iS WoRkInG bUt ThE EnCrYpTiOn Is NoT!!!!
Encryption works now.

Next:
    Make a pickle file where i can store the variable i need to save.
