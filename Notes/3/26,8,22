Figured out that the code is copying what is in the file, as writing it without deleting the previous text. 00:10:42
Copy and pasted more code, and now i fixed some but more errors are coming. My brain is stir fry. 00:41:01
WHY THE HELL IS IT NOT VIEWING THE FILE THAT WAS CHOSEN????? 00:49:53
Fixed back buttons 00:58:29
Files are turning into python files????!!! 01:01:32
