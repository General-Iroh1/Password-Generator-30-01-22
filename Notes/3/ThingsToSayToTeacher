What this code does, is it counts if any occurences of the reason for the password - and if it does it removes everything in the file, which makes it seem like its rewriting it.
Then, it asks for 3 words and replaces certain letters with symbols.

Key = value of password.
Directly reference key.
Treats file as giant string. (single)
Stores all info on 1 password in 1 line. 
Delete original file - make a new one.
With giant string looks at if reason is there (it will be in 1 line)
Stores all of the other lines into a dictionary.
With the new file it writes everything in the dictionary inside there.
