Fixed error, however, it is not writing the original to the file.
Found out that it was writing to a different file.
Finally, its writing to the correct file.
It works now, but the file now has an exclamation mark next to it instead of the sign for a .txt file.

Next:
    Try to make it so it can use variables to recognise the file - so i don't have to keep changing the code.
