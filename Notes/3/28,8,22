Deleted tons of copy and pasted lines, because that was part of the previous encryption that has 0 preotection. 00:18:56
When viewing files, it views it as blank.
Also when new account is created, it will make an error when creating the 6 buttons
When viewing passwords, whichever file is viewed first will always be viewed.
Think i figured out why first file is always being viewed, I have set a variable to the first file and i assigned that to all the buttons. 00:34:52
I was wrong, now its viewing everything as blank again 00:48:44
