When moving folder for password into account folder, the password folder is merged with the account folder.
When trying to fix it - invald argument error found.
Fixed error - however folder is still merged.
Figured out that folder is meant to be merged - as there was no other file in the account folder.
Making other parts of code follow what i just did.

Next:
    Create password has to make it in folder
    Delete password has to view correct folder
    View password has to view correct folder.
    Display all screens on 1 screen. (delete everything on screen1 and put things on screen2 there.)
