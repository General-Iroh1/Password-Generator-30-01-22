tryed making encryption read regular words instead of bytes
i didnt do anything and now its viewing a key
testing making the thing i want to import into a set
when making it into a set it views everything perfectly but i need it to be a string
i think i can just write the variables to a file without pickle and then i will be able to extract it.

next:
    figure out how to make it view words not keys.
