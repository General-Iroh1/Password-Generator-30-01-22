Working on creating a temporary key that you need to use view password or delete password.
Countdown for temporary key complete - however it stops counting when program is closed.
Making a file to write countdown to, and then continue it when code is run again.
Just realised that if i do that then the timer wont go on while the code isn't active.
Searching on google how to create countdown while code isn't active.
